# Final_cap -Customer-conversion-prediction

**#Project Goal**
The goal of the Customer Conversion Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict 
whether a client will subscribe to the insurance based on their demographic and marketing data. 
The project aims to help the insurance company identify the customers that are most likely to convert, 
so that they can be targeted via call and the cost of telephonic marketing campaigns can be reduced. 
The historical sales data provided will be used to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. 
The analysis of the model will be done to identify the important factors that contribute towards the conversion and the AUROC metric will be used to evaluate the model's performance. 
The main objective of the project is to develop an accurate and efficient model that 
can aid the insurance company in improving its sales conversion rate and reducing marketing costs.

**#Project Implementation Steps#**
1. Import Necessary Librarires
2. Import the data sets and keep in local machine and load in jupyter notebook
3. Clean the dataset
4. Perfrom EDA on the dataset
5. Perform encoding whereever necessary on the dataset
6. Before applying any machine learning algorithm split the dataset and scale(standard scaler) it and also perfrom smote oversampling technique to balance the data set
7. use machine learning algorithm suitable for classification like logistic regression , decision tree, random forest , Xg boost
8. Evaluate the model and compare the auroc curve and also observe the feature importances
